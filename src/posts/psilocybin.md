<p>Psilocybin ("magic mushrooms") is a psychedelic drug that is now
being studied as a substance that can make dramatic cures to mental
health with a single dose. It is being studied at John Hopkins,
Imperial College of London, NYU and other places.

</p><p>My friend Lucy is a Nurse Practicioner and she is thinking of
running a psilocybin retreat at a nice Airbnb in nature. Three days
journalizing your life aspirations, meditating, walking, listening
to music, healthy eating. Fourth day psilocybin. Fifth day reflection.
