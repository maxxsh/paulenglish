<p>I have mixed feelings about software patents. Some patents are
ridiculous, giving too broad coverage and/or for being obvious
and/or for having prior art. I also dislike IP companies who simply
create and buy patents not to use, but to block and sue others.
And possibly patents should be used to block larger companies
but not small startups? I'm not sure how I feel about hardware
vs. software patents. Some people think hardware patents are ok
but software patents should not exist, but that doesn't make sense to me.

</p><p>I think that patents other than the above are useful to
identify the original inventors and to protect inventors.

</p><p>Here are the patents I have gotten over the years:
