<p>Here is what I have learned about meditation.

</p><p>Benefits I have seen for myself: decreased stress and anxiety, and
ability to respond to most things in a calm manner. Also decreased
irritation and anger.

</p><p>There are studies coming out all the time proving that meditation
causes physical changes in the brain. E.g., if you meditate ten
minutes a day for three weeks, an MRI will show changes to your wiring.

</p><p>Here is how I meditate:

</p><ul>

<li>Sit upright in a firm chair. (You don't want a chair too
comfortable, as you'll doze off or will have a hard time focusing.)
  
</li><li>Set my phone timer for ten minutes. Close my eyes.

</li><li>Focus on my breath. Don't control the breath, but notice it.
(I am also now studying
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pranayama">pranayama</a>.)

</li></ul>

<h3>Distraction</h3>

<p>The most difficult thing about meditation is dealing with
distraction. Sometimes I sit for just ten minutes, and nine minutes
in, I realize I've been thinking about work the entire time.

</p><p>When this first started happening to me, I thought "This is hard. I
can't do this".

</p><p>But then I continued to practice, and I went to many meditation
classes, and I've discovered a distraction solution which works for me.

</p><p>Malcolm Gladwell famously wrote that to become an expert at
something, you had to practice it for 10,000 hours.

</p><p>I think he probably just made up that number, but it inspired me to
come up with a rule for meditation.

</p><p>"To become a meditation master, you must be distracted 10,000
times."

</p><p>Each time you get distracted, instead of punishing yourself, you
should be celebrating that you NOTICED that you were distracted, and
that you have the OPPORTUNITY to refocus on your breath.

</p><p>This precise refocusing is like doing pushups for your brain. You
are building a habit to transform interruption into calmness. The more
you do this, the better you will handle all types of interruption in
daily life. It will become automatic. When someone cuts you off in
traffic, rather than getting angry, an experienced meditation
student will just be calm.

</p><p>Please share your meditation stories with me, as I would like to
learn from other's experiences.
