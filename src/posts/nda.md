<p>In business, people use non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) when they
need to talk with another party about something confidential-- if the
other party wants to hear the idea (might get some benefit from
working with the inventor) they sometimes will agree to sign an NDA,
and thus to promise to keep the idea confidential.

</p><p>If you are an entrepreneur, note that professional <a href="/venture.html">venture capitalists</a> (VCs) and most big
companies will generally never sign your NDAs. They don't want the
hassle of lots of poor unhappy entrepreneurs wasting their time later
with lawsuits. They figure if you are coming to ask for their help,
you need to trust them enough to tell them the idea. If you don't
trust the VC, then don't bother calling. The VC says that they live
and die on their reputations, so of course they would not steal your
idea. In general, I think most VCs are inclined to be fair, but use
common sense about who and how many people you tell your idea.

</p><p>In my experience, most entrepreneurs are too paranoid about
confidentiality. If you don't take a chance and
<a href="/trust.html">trust</a> someone who might be able to help you,
you'll never get anywhere.

</p><p>When I'm at an early stage in developing a new business plan, I
just write the following at the top of the plan:

</p><p><i>"Confidentiality: Paul asks that you not show or tell anyone
this idea without first calling to ask his OK. If
you tell one person you trust, they will tell one person they trust,
and so on. If this idea gets out too early, Paul's business could be
ruined. Thanks."</i>

</p><p>In business, NDAs <b>are</b> important when you get a little
further along, when both sides know just enough about each other to
know they are seriously interested in pursuing a relationship.

</p><p>When I've sat at the big business side of the table and
entrepreneurs have come to me, I've refused to sign their NDAs but
told them to tell me just enough that they are comfortable telling
without me signing an NDA.

</p><p>So it all comes down to taking some measured risks with good people
who can help you, and then expecting an NDA only when the other party
is already knowledgable and motivated enough about your idea to really
want to do something with you.
