<p>I'm reading
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000FA5SGG/">Healing Back Pain:
The Mind-Body Connection</a> by John Sarno. It is fascinating.

</p><p>Dr. Sarno describes a concept he calls paranightmare: when you are
about to have a strong negative emotion, sometimes the mind changes it
to a physical pain, so as to avoid the emotional pain.
Dr. Sarno says that chronic pain is caused by repressed emotions in the
unconscious mind.

<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=paranightmare">paranightmare</a>
didn't show any useful results.)
