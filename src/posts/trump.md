<p>Donald Trump is the most immoral, corrupt and incompetent
President of my lifetime.

</p><ol>
<li>Concentration camps on our southern border, separating kids from
their parents, with horrific living conditions, kids dying while in
care, and many reports of abuse.
  
</li><li>"Grab them by the pussy" tape, and dozens of claims of sexual assaults.

</li><li><a href="https://www.politifact.com/personalities/donald-trump/statements/byruling/false/">Constant lies</a>,
even on things as simple as
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn_pQyfT180">Merry
Christmas</a>. (He is obsessed with Obama.)

</li><li>Climate change denier. Pulling out of the Paris Agreement.

</li><li><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/28/climate/trump-administration-war-on-science.html">Science silencer</a>.

</li><li>Pardoning horrific war criminals, even in cases where an entire
SEAL team testified against the criminal.

</li><li>Massive tax breaks for the rich, which did not help the economy or
the middle class:

</li><li>Guns: parrots the fictional NRA narrative that our gun deaths are
due to mental health. Why are their so few gun deaths in 
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/14/upshot/compare-these-gun-death-rates-the-us-is-in-a-different-world.html">all
other rich western countries</a>?
Do you think they don't have mental health issues?
The GOP won't even let the CDC study gun death.
  
</li><li>Racism:

including quote: "laziness is a trait in blacks".

Park Five</a> call for death penalty.
</li><li>Muslim ban.

</li><li>Being a driver behind the "birther" movement.
</li><li>Quote: "The removal of our beautiful statues and monuments."
</li></ul>

</li><li>Bullying, with constant name calling of anyone who is opposed to
him, and even mocking a 16 year old autistic girl, and a

</li><li>Impeached for two offenses.
  
</li><li>Gross incompetence, for example, watch this
