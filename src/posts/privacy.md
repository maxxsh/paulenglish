<p>Here are a few things I do to protect my privacy.

</p><ol>

<li>Get a 
<a href="https://www.usps.com/manage/po-boxes.htm">PO Box</a>
from the USPS, and use that address for my contact
info anytime I have to give an address but don't need anything
delivered. E.g., nonprofits, government agencies, insurance companies, etc.

</li><li>Set up a second
<a href="https://www.gmail.com">gmail</a>
account to be used exclusively by companies,
e.g., amazon, netflix, random ecommerce sites, government agencies,
etc. I only give out my "real" email address to friends and family.

</li><li>Set up a 
<a href="https://voice.google.com">Google Voice</a>
number that does not ring my phone,
but which instead has messages transcribed and emailed to my 2nd
email address.

</li></ol>
