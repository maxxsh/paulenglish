<p>I am obsessed with brand, and domain names are step one for me.

</p><p>Like a lot of entrepreneurs, I have
<a href="/selection.html">more ideas than I have time for</a>,
and for each new idea, the idea is not real until I first own a great
domain name for it. Right now, I own almost 300 domain names, and with
each one, there is an idea for a new company or project.

</p><p>Here are my criteria for a great domain name:

</p><ul>
<li>Easy to remember after hearing it said once.
</li><li>Easy to spell after hearing it said once, even if you hear it over
a bad phone line.
</li><li>In general, I strongly prefer a .com name whenever possible.
</li><li>One word .com domain names can often cost $100K or more, so those
are generally unattainable unless you raise VC for your idea.
</li><li>I don't love misspellings, but I guess if someone sees it once and
can remember it and the spelling, it can sometimes work. E.g.,
carz.com or something like that.
</li><li>Two word .com names are findable with enough time and effort
looking for 100s of possibilities for your idea.
</li><li>The greater your budget, the better name you will find. I had to
pay $10k for roadwars.com (stay tuned for that product).
</li></ul>

<p>Good luck!
