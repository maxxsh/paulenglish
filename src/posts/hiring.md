</p><p>If you are looking to build a company, your most important skill is
hiring. If you do not get excited about this, and do not always think
about networking and hiring, it means you need an equal partner who
does, and who is world class at it.

</p><p>Why is hiring so important? Think back to teams you have run in the
past. Think about the best person you ever managed... Think about the
worst person you ever managed... Want more of the former, and less (or
none) of the latter?

</p><h3>Hiring Criteria</h3>

<p>Here is how I hire, listed in priority order.

</p><ol>

<li><b>Bandwidth</b>. I'm a snob for intelligence. I like to surround myself
with people who are much smarter and faster than me. People who can
juggle ten things at once, and handle curve balls. This is a
requirement in an entrepreneurial activity, as by definition you are
doing something new, so you have to learn (from your customers)
while you are building.

</li><li><b>Attitude</b>. I like people who have fire in their belly, who
are outwardly competitive, and who are very goal / results driven. I
like people who are fun and who laugh a lot, including at
themselves. I like people who are so confident in their skills that
they are openly and instantly humble about things they are not good
at. I like people who delight in seeing others perform, and who
delight in blowing away customers with awesome products and
services. I like people who are open and honest.

</li><li><b>Experience</b>. I want people who have been successful at
something-- getting stuff done. They don't need to have done what I'm
hiring them for, but they need to bring some new success experience to
the team. (I once hired a guy who had an olympic medal in rowing; I
thought that was just the coolest thing; I did not need him to row,
but I knew if he could get an olympic medal, it said a lot about his
determination etc.)

</li><li><b>Lack of dysfunctional behavior</b>. I will not tolerate anyone who
hurts the team. I don't care how awesome they are. If they are a jerk,
work will not be fun (for me or my team mates) and that is not
acceptable. We all have insecurities and much dysfunctional behavior
is bad responses to such.
</li></ol>

<h3>Contract Recruiter</h3>

<p>Your most important hire is your contract recruiter, the partner
you will work with to hire the rest of your team. This person must be
someone you trust completely, and someone you enjoy spending lots of
time with. If you hire the wrong recruiter, fire them immediately and
go find someone better. Your recruiter must have a phenomenal track
record. Be prepared to pay lots of money for a superstar recruiter,
they are well worth it. The CEO and each hiring manager should meet
with this person EVERY DAY even if just for five minutes. I like to
have all new hardcopy resumes handed to me by the recruiter, and I
review them all WHILE THE RECRUITER IS STANDING IN MY OFFICE. This
might seem like a waste of time, but it is not. If you do this, and
think aloud while scanning, you recruiter will VERY QUICKLY get tuned
to your criteria, and you will find that you will start getting much
better candidates. I also like to have the recruiter's office to be
right next to mine, so I get to see him/her all the time, and everyone
else knows the priority of hiring.

</p><h3>Headhunters</h3>

<p>Some headhunters are good, many are bad. With some work, you and
your contract recruiter can just leverage your own networks. If you do
end up using any headhunters, here are a couple important rules: (a)
train your managers to never take calls or receive resumes from
headhunters unless they have already signed a contract with your
contract recruiter or HR manager, and (b) do not let the headhunter be
involved in offer negotiations, as they can screw them up to just to
try jack up the offer/fee, and you also want to directly get this
important experience with your new potential employee.

</p><h3>Seven Day Rule</h3>

<p>One of the nice things about using a database is that it will show
you how quickly you are hiring, as you can see how long a resume has
been in the system. I try very hard to make an offer within seven days
of anyone on my team first hearing about a candidate. I'm not
kidding. Does this mean my team rushes, and thus makes mistakes? No,
it means we are very focused on our hiring process. We can make better
decisions that our competitors who are not as disciplined, and we can
save time, and (perhaps most importantly) we can energize candidates
by showing them how fast we can move. Example: get a resume on Monday,
phone screen, schedule interview for Tuesday or Wednesday, backchannel
references after that, then second interview on Thursday or Friday,
with offer that night, acceptance by next Monday.  This requires a
very good process so you can efficiently get all the steps done well
at this speed!

</p><h3>Visitors</h3>

<p>Train all of your people to be energized and nice to all candidates
and visitors to your workplace. Make eye contact with all visitors,
give them a smile and a hello. (Note: I once took a diversity training
course and was shocked to learn that white people do not make eye
contact with people of color; this is horrible!) Ask the visitor if
they want a soda or need any help. Do not ever leave a job candidate
sitting on a couch waiting for someone. If you see someone sitting
alone (bored), energize them by saying hello and chatting with them.
If you train all your people to do this, it very well could mean the
difference in winning over that superstar candidate, and also having
ALL candidates always speak highly of their experience with your team.

</p><h3>The Interview</h3>

<p>30-60 minutes. Do not ever be late, even by two minutes. Do not
ever take any interruptions, even if you get a phone call from the
president of the united states. Show this candidate that you came into
work today to meet with them, that they are the most important person
on your list. Be high energy, have fun! Ask them about the person they
just met. This is an easy warm up question, and can tell you how
perceptive this person is
(<a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553375067/paulenglish-20">EQ</a>
etc). Be focused. Know ahead of time
your plan, what you are evaluating this person for and what questions
you will ask. Do not let the candidate lead the interview, take
charge. Give the candidate immediate feedback, tell them something
about them that excites you! (Do not ever give anyone false feedback.)

</p><p>Ask the candidate about specific projects to get their philosophies
based on something real which happened. Else it is too easy for them
to mis-speak if they are speaking in generaliities.

</p><p>Challenge the candidate, give them difficult problems to solve. You
can get away with this, and not only not offend the candidate, but
energize them, if you do this correctly and handle the candidate's
entire experience with your team (including phone calls, hallway
meetings, interviews, etc) correctly.

</p><p>Each interviewer will develop their own favorite questions and
style; I have my own which I'm not listing here since it won't help if
others use the same techniques. :-)

</p><p>When you are done, bring the candidate to the next person on the
list. (Do not have an admin do this, and do not leave the person alone
in a conference room without calling the next person first.) If you
have a minute, tell the next interviewer which things to probe (if you
have some discomforts) and which things are important to this
candidate (if such a thing came up).

</p><h3>The Decision</h3>

<p>For any position, ahead of time have a job description
including requirements, responsibilities, and work style needed. All
interviewers for a position must know this stuff. I have candidates
meet 4-6 people, no more than that. Trust your interviewers, give them
veto power. Better to lose a good person (if you are good at hiring
you can find another) than to hire a dud. I usually do a five minute
stand up meeting with all interviewers (or the key few decision
makers) to make our decision. This must be done on the day of each
interview, and you your interview team should come to that meeting
with their already bias of thumbs up-or-down.

</p><h3>The Close</h3>

<p>Once you decide you want someone, do whatever it takes to get them
to join you. Sell them on your mission, show them how you will be
changing the world. Make them love you :-) and show them how much the
team loves them and why they will be so important and successful in
this team. Consider bribes (flowers <a href="http://www.berries.com">etc</a> sent to their home). When
necessary for critical positions, take the candidate out to dinner,
sometimes with spouses.

</p><p>Close the candidate on the job, not on the compensation. I'm not
kidding. I always try to get the candidate to tell me they accept the
job before we talk about compensation. And then negotiate a fair and
good package. Ask the candidate the following: of all their job
opportunities, which one will make them drive a little faster to work
in the morning, which one seems the most exciting, the best team, the
best mission. You want your opportunity to be the best one for them.

</p><h3>Post Hire</h3>

<ol>
<li><b>Requirements</b>. Every one of my team members, regardless of
their role, is required only to do two things: be world-class high
quality output at your field, and make the team stronger. It is not
enough to be team neutral (not to hurt the team), you must make the
team stronger. At the end of the day, ask yourself what you did to
help the team? Did you encourage people? Did you give people (at all
levels) honest and immediate feedback and coaching? Did you laugh a
lot and have fun?

</li><li><b>Reverse indoctrination</b>. Some companies train new people on
the culture and rules, so they can get up to speed. I think this is
often a bad idea. I like to instead do the reverse, go out of your way
to learn from new people all the time, before you warp them to become
a clone of your pre-existing team.

</li><li><b>Networking</b>. If your new hire is good (hopefully!), use them
to network to find more good people to hire!

</li></ol>

<p>Make sure you are constantly learning how to hire better. Read
books. Read blogs. Talk with your team about this all the
time. See also
