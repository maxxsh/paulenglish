<p>Htrack is an iPhone app to help you track healthy habits with
friends. Your goals could be to lose weight, increase exercise,
decrease drinking, increase meditation, or really anything you want
to track.

</p><p>Htrack is designed to make it as easy as possible to enter a food
item or activity, typically with only 1-2 keystrokes or clicks. You
can either type in text (e.g., salad, burger) or click on a keyword
(running, meditation). You can define your own keywords for anything
which is a common activity for you.

</p><p>But the magic of Htrack is the use of it with a healthy habits
buddy. If you add someone as a friend in Htrack, they can see all your
diary entries and leave you feedback on each item, either by clicking
an emoticon button or by typing in text feedback.
  
</p><p>Please see <a href="https://www.htrack.app">Htrack.app</a> for more
info, and search for "Htrack" from the iOS App Store.
