<p>I cofounded Lola Travel in 2015 with
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/billo/">Bill O'Donnell</a><a> and
</a><a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-schwenk-43824/">Paul Schwenk</a>,
guys I've worked with for decades.

</p><p>The original vision for Lola was to be a mobile app to allow
travelers to message a concierge 24x7 to make travel plans on their
behalf.

</p><p>We learned during our first year that to our surprise, 80% of our
users were business travelers. This led to our first pivot, where we
started to focus on business travelers exclusively.

</p><p>We interviewed dozens of business travelers to learn what was
different about business vs. leisure, noting that a few of us built
Kayak so we already knew consumer travel. We learned many things in
these interviews, for example, business users choose flights based on
(a) their favorite airlines (b) the schedule, and lastly (c) the
price. This led to a design which looked a bit different than consumer
sites and apps.

</p><p>
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kristapappas/">Krista Pappas</a>
and I developed a five year exclusive partnership with American
Express Global Business Travel (GBT) to provide travel service to
their small and mid-size customers. This was an important partnership
for us, not just from a validation and revenue standpoint, but also
from a learning standpoint, as GBT is the #1 best solution for larger
company travel.

</p><p>In 2018, we hired
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikevolpe/">Mike Volpe</a> to
join as CEO, and then I became CTO. This was a fanastic move for Lola,
as Mike is a much stronger executive leader than me, and it allowed me
to focus on the things I like the most -- people ops (with
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/staceylynnscott/">Stacey
Scott</a>), product strategy (with a team of product managers) and design
(with
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lincolnjackson/">Lincoln
Jackson</a> and other designers).
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dennis-doughty-17a24/">Dennis
Doughty</a>
led
architecture, and 
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stasonis/">Chris Stasonis</a>
led growing and managing the
engineering teams and processes.

</p><p>Over time, Lola started paying attention to other roles in business
travel - the executive assistant, and the finance leader.

</p><p>We learned that power business travelers already have formed
"shorthands" with their <b>executive assistants</b> which made booking travel
as simple as sending a text message or email, and then trusting that
the assistant already knew all your preferences and your calendar,
and that s/he would just book the right thing for you. Based on this
learning, we built a "book on behalf" feature that let any Lola
user book travel for any of their colleagues, without having to
enter all of that person's info each time.

</p><p>For <b>finance leaders</b>, Lola focused on travel policies and
financial reporting, given that travel and entertainment is often the
biggest discretionary expense a company has.

</p><p>2019 was a fantastic year for Lola -- we figured out product market
fit, and we were growing rapidly.

</p><p>When the Covid-19 pandemic hit, business travel stopped, and our
revenue went to zero. In March 2020, we began an aggressive pivot from
SMB travel management to SMB travel and <b>spend
management</b>. Instead of going to CFOs and saying they should buy
Lola to reduce the cost and complexity of travel planning, we then
went to CFOs and said we could reduce the cost and complexities
of <b>all</b> employee spend.

</p><p>Lola developed its own corporate Visa card with real-time
authorizations tied to actual budgets. This allowed finance and other
executives to always have a real-time view of budgets, and forced
spend to always stay within budget. Our software allowed users to set
up budgets and sub-budgets with delegation for budget ownership. We
also built a simple-to-use invoice / accounts payable solution.

</p><p>In October 2021, Lola was sold to Capital One. This has been a
fantastic next step on our journey, and the Lola team is now focused
on spend and payment innovation for millions of businesses, where we
will be bringing new products to market based on Lola tech and
Capital One tech.

</p><p>I am proud of what we designed and built at Lola, but more
importantly than that, I'm proud of us developing a strong team of
people who worked exceptionally well together, and who took care of
each other in every sense of the word.

</p><p>Lola was also lucky to have a gifted board, but the one person I
want to call out explicitly is our Chair,
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gailgoodman/">Gail Goodman</a>.
She has been an
incredible guide for me over the years. And finally, I could not have
done Lola without
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/eliza-b-5b6b3036/">Eliza
Bladon</a>, and I'm grateful to all other Lola employees -- past and
present -- for building this company together.
