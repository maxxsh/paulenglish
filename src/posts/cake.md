The following recipe is for the best chocolate cake I have ever
tasted, and I'm a pretty huge fan of chocolate cake. :)
My daughter and I like to make this cake, if you make it,
drop me a line and let me know how it turned out.

This recipe is from "Old Favorites from New Friends",
The Wellesley Newcomer's Club Cookbook, published in 1995,
with typography/design/indexing by my friend Ellena M.

| 1 C.hot coffee         | 1/2 C.sour cream, optional but makes it even moister. (Can substitute applesauce.) |

| 3/4 C.cocoa            |

Preheat oven to 325 F. Grease and flour a 9x13 inch pan. In a large
mixing bowl, combine the ingredients in order, one at a time, mixing
well at low speed after each addition. (Do not mix fast or too much.)
Pour into the pan. Bake in a preheated oven for about 40 minutes, or
until a toothpick inserted comes out clean. Serve with powdered sugar
or whipped cream (or chocolate frosting).

NOTE: For best results, bake one day before serving.

YIELD: 12 to 15 servings.
