<p>Here are some things I have learned about reducing pain
and suffering, learned from
<a href="/buddhism.html">Buddhist teachers</a>,
from friends, and from personal mindfulness practice.

</p><h1>Holding Pain in Your Hand</h1>

<p>When I feel pain -- fear, shame, guilt, stress -- I used to feel it
strongly in my chest. It can feel intense -- "knives in" -- as if my
ribs are turning in to my heart.

</p><p>A technique I've learned is to visualize this pain as something
you can hold in your hand, like a rock. When you are suffering,
you can look at the imagined rock in your hand, looking closely
at it, and saying - "I see you, pain. I see you, suffering.
I am holding you in my hand. You are not in my heart. You can
not kill me. Some day soon, I am going to be strong enough to throw
you away, but for now, I see you."

</p><p>Removing the pain from your heart removes its power.  
  
</p><h1>Anger</h1>

<p>A common type of self-inflicted pain is anger we feel towards
someone else. You can <a href="/anger.html">read more about it here</a>.
See also
<a href="/trust.html">trust models</a>, as both of these 
concepts deal with how you respond to injury from others.

</p><h1>Present Moment</h1>

<p>"The past is history, the future is a mystery, and the present
moment is a gift."

</p><p>Suffering is caused by thinking about what has happened to you in
the past, or what might happen to you in the future.

</p><p>There is no psychological pain in the present moment.

</p><p>Sometimes when you are feeling dark, you should give yourself a
small gift (could be simple), force your face muscles to smile, and
decide to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worry_doll">put off worrying
until tomorrow</a>.
