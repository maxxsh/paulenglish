(Here were some

<ul>
<li>"It seems like he has such an active radar on things that piss him off
and he has the mentality that he can solve it.  I loved that and I
want to be more like that."
</li><li>"I found him fascinating"
</li><li>"Fantastic hearing how he makes himself vulnerable to employees.
  I've worked for founders who have done the opposite, that change
  would have made a world of difference."
</li><li>"Great tactics.  You typically don't actually see tactics from these
  amazing people, I appreciate how he shared actual things I could do"
</li><li>"I'm so grateful, that was absolutely phenomenal"
</li><li>"Something about him really, really resonated with me.  You said you
  have seen him speak before -- do you have any notes?  Can I watch the
  other section's video as well?"  (note, have never had a student ask
  this before!)
</li><li>"That was the best speaker I've ever seen across all my classes."
</li><li>"I found him insightful, mature, humble -- the type of founder who
  has thought through stuff.  No wonder people want to work for him"
</li><li>"The best speaker so far -- his role play for firing was super
  valuable"
</li></ul>

<li>THAT WAS MY FAVORITE TALK BY FAR
<br>no WONDER you are working for paul what an incredible leader and mentor
<br>holy shit i'm blown away i have 4 pages full of notes
</li><li>he was my fav speaker. Still thinking about why that is but probs
(a) he's just a really damn nice dude, and (b) his answers were all
succincts and actionable; he made things seem simple even though I
am fully aware they're only results of a lifetime of starting
companies
</li><li>I really liked the idea of people-focused interview questions. His
  example interview question of explaining things your coworkers did
  well / didn't do well was great, and it's a unique perspective I
  don't think a lot of companies consider for product roles.
</li><li>Really enjoyed hearing from Paul and took lots of notes!
  Especially interesting to hear about his thoughts on cowboy and
  craftsman engineers, and making sure founding teams are strong at
  recruiting, and not using team polls to determine which features to
  develop.
</li><li>I have so many good thoughts: (a) his answers
  felt <b>genuinely</b> thoughtful and carefully considered. It seemed
  like he really wanted to help us. (b) he is very intentional with
  his strategy and wasn't afraid to share the details. Loved hearing
  the three-pronged product strategy (table stakes, innovation,
  refinement), interview questions, and culture building. was way more
  useful that he didn't hold back. (c) last answer just gave me hope
  that it is possible to be a successful founder and philanthropic.
</li><li>I really appreciated his advice on leadership - I could tell that
  he genuinely cares about the people he works with and the causes he
  supports, and it really gives me hope that it's possible to be
  conscientious and successful. I love that he didn't shy away from
  advocating for balance in his lifestyle, and that he pushes for
  ethical and transparency decision-making for buiding loyalty. I also
  really liked his practical advice about developing product features
  and recruiting!
