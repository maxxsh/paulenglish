9. [Boston Light Software](/bostonlight.html), a maker of ecommerce software, sold to Intuit, where I served as VP Technology for almost four years.

10. [Intermute](/intermute.html), a security software company co-founded with my brother Ed English. Sold to Trend Micro.

11. [Speed Games](/cupid.html), a company I started in high school, where my sole game was Cupid for the Commodore 64. I licensed this to Games by Apollo, and used proceeds to buy an Apple ][+ with 48K of memory, an eprom burner, and a dot matrix printer. Although my licensing deal was only $25k, in many ways this was my most meaningful startup, as it taught me that code could turn into cash.
